There are several parameters you can set that affect the appearance of the theme.

```toml
[params]

# Sets the primary accent color of the theme. Used as the background color for
# the header, and in some other places.
primaryBackgroundColor = "#7649bd"

# Used as the text color when text is shown on top of the primary color.
primaryTextColor = "#fff"

# If true, a "Home" page will be shown in the navigation menu for list pages.
# If false, list pages are not shown in the navigation menu at all.
showListPages = false

# Selects the light or dark variant of the theme. Value must be "light" or
# "dark".
themeVariant = "dark"
```
